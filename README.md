Excited to share my latest project: A Voice-Enabled Customer Management System!

In today's fast-paced business environment, maintaining strong customer relationships is essential for local businesses. To address this need, I developed a voice-enabled customer management system that streamlines customer interactions while providing an intuitive user experience.

Technical Stack:
Frontend: Built with Streamlit, allowing for a seamless web application interface that supports both manual input and voice interaction.
Backend: Utilized SQLite for a lightweight, serverless database solution, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.
Speech Recognition: Integrated the SpeechRecognition library to capture and interpret voice commands, enabling users to search for customers hands-free.
Date Management: Used Pythonâ€™s datetime module to handle enrollment dates and ensure accurate data capture.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features:
Customer Data Management: Users can manually enter customer details, including name, date of birth, phone number, and reward points.
Voice Search Functionality: Customers can be searched using voice input, significantly improving the ease of access and user experience.
Dynamic Points Management: Upon searching, users can view existing points and have the option to add or deduct points in real time, with updates reflected in the database.
Data Security: Implemented best practices to secure customer data and ensure compliance with data protection regulations (to be enhanced in future versions).
User-Friendly UI: Designed an intuitive user interface with clear navigation and feedback mechanisms, making the application accessible to users of all technical levels.

ðŸ”’ Future Enhancements:
I plan to address some existing bottlenecks, such as:
Data Security: Implementing stronger encryption and authentication measures to enhance data protection.
Cloud Deployment: Migrating the application to a cloud platform to ensure scalability and reliability for local businesses.
Mobile Optimization: Enhancing the interface for mobile use, allowing business owners to manage customer relationships on the go.
